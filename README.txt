A Two Hour Game
Copyright (c) 2011 Will Luongo and Bryce Mata

This is a basic ruby game we developed in just over 2 hours (we blew our deadline by 5 minutes, so shoot us... AN EMAIL!). It only requires ruby and the gosu gem.

To find the chicks, listen to the chirps: they will get louder as you move closer using the arrow keys. When you think you are next to the object hiding the chick, press the spacebar! Once you've found all three, you will be congratulated and can die with a sense of accomplishment and meaning.
